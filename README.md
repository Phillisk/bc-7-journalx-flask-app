## Installation

You may also install the app on your local machine.

## Prerequisites 

You should have a working installation of Python 2.7 as well as pip. It is recommended that you use a virtual environment for this project.

### To install the app:

1. Clone this repository git clone https://github.com/Phillisk/bc-7-journalx-flask-app.git

2. Install requirements pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the server python run.py

## Workflow
The user creates an account and logs into the site. They can then view their entries, edit and delete them.

## Icebox Features

The following are features that I did not implement in the application:

* Notifications: users notified whenever they update or delete an entry
* Email confirmation as part of the registration process
* Clickable tags.
